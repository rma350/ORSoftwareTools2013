Complete the following steps:

1. Close Eclipse.
2. Download the project in [this zip archive](../../../assets/cut-generation-heuristics-and-callbacks/tspSolverV3.zip), or if you prefer, [check it out](https://github.com/rma350/ORSoftwareTools2013) using git.
3. Unzip it and put the folder _tspSolver_ inside the directory of your Eclipse workspace.
4. Now open Eclipse by clicking on _eclipse.exe_.
5. Go to _File_ → _Import_, then select _General_ → _Existing Projects into Workspace_ and hit the _Next_ button. You will now be asked to _Select a directory to search for existing Eclipse projects_. Click the top radio button for _Select a root directory_: then click the _Browse_ button. A file selector should open already in your workspace directory. Select the folder _tspSolver_ that we just put here. In the panel below labeled _Projects:_, _tspSolver_ should pop with with a check box next to it already checked. Go the bottom and hit _Finish_.
6. The project should now be visible in in the _Project Explorer_ on the left panel of the Eclipse GUI. Expand the project and the _src_ folder. Make sure everything compiles (there should be no files with a red 'x' on them). If it does not, fix your build path so all the JARs are properly located (ask a TA).
