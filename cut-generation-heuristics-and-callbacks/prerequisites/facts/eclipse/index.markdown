Eclipse is an [Integrated Development Environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) that provides a variety of features to make writing and compiling your java code easier. There are no make files (for C programmers) and there is a graphical interface for adding libraries your code depends upon. Eclipse also provides auto completion, refactoring, and code generation.
